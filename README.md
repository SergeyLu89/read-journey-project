it to your personal library.

#### My library page

The library page will display a list of books added by the user from the
recommended ones, and also provides the opportunity to create your own book by
filling out the required form fields. When you click on the book image, a modal
window with detailed information opens. "Start reading" button redirects to the
"My training" page. Clicking on the "trash" button removes the book from the
list.

#### My training page

Displays the reading status of the current book. By entering the starting page
number in the field and clicking on the "To start" button, the user begins
reading. By entering the number of the page on which the user finished reading
and clicking on the "To stop" button, reading stops and a block with detailed
information about progress is displayed. The block is presented in the form of a
diary, which tracks reading speed, the number of pages read per day, or in the
form of a chart showing the percentage of pages read.
